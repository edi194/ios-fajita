# ios-beryllium: the iOS 16 port (archived README)

> This was the top-level README while the project ran iOS 16 (branch `main`). Paths are the ones of that time: the bootloader `enxerto/` was called `shim/` there. The current README is [`../README.md`](../README.md).


**Apple's iOS 16 running on a Poco F1 (`beryllium`, Qualcomm SDM845).**

A port of [ios-sweet](https://github.com/dipa-studio/ios-sweet) (iOS 16 on the Redmi Note 10 Pro) to the Xiaomi Poco F1. The same XNU kernel (xnu-8796) runs both phones; the Poco F1 specifics are kernel patches 0082+ (selected at runtime from the device tree, `bsd/dev/sweet_board.h`) and `tools/mkadt.py --board beryllium`. On top runs the **unmodified iPhone X iOS 16.7.16 (20H392) userland**.

As of **2026-10-20** the Poco F1 boots to the **iOS lock and home screen with its wallpaper**: touch (including the swipe-up home gesture), buttons, navigation, Control Center, Settings and Safari work, and the phone shows up on a computer as **USB Ethernet**: SSH (`ssh root@192.168.7.2`, key-only, dropbear), a live kernel log, and internet shared from the Mac (Safari loads and renders sites). Photos works: pictures pushed with `tools/sweet-push-photo.sh` show up in the Photos app. Sideloading works: `tools/sweet-install-ipa.sh App.ipa` re-signs a decrypted iOS 16 arm64 app, installs it to /Applications and registers it (system app; App Store downloads are FairPlay-encrypted and will not run). Everything is rendered by the CPU.

> Experimental, not a usable phone OS. It installs into `userdata` and **erases Android's user data**; security is mostly off.

## Poco F1 status

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Boot | Stock ABL, `fastboot boot` of the shim (boot.img v1, Image.gz + the ROM's DTB); nothing flashed to boot partitions |
| CPU | All 8 cores (4x A55 + 4x A75) via PSCI, `cpus=8` |
| Memory | 0x1_00000000 + 0xfcc00000 (upper DDR bank, above every Qualcomm carve-out) |
| Storage | UFS (same host as sweet), iOS root = HFS+ in `userdata` (sda21, LUN 0) |
| Display | Continuous-splash framebuffer 1080x2246 @0x9d400000; iOS renders at @2x (750x1624, ADT `--display-scale 2`), scaled to fit (`sweetfb_scale=1`) or stretched (`=2`); page flipping on the MDP VIG0 pipe (`sweetfb_flip=1`) |
| Touch | Tianma panel's Novatek NT36672A at 0x01 on I2C14; the QUP is GSI-only, so the bus is bit-banged on GPIO 33/34 with the TLMM edge latch of GPIO 31 as IRQ |
| Buttons | Power and volume-down (PM8998 PON), volume-up (PM8998 GPIO6), SPMI arbiter v5 |
| Battery | PMI8998 fuel gauge (real SOC, voltage, current) and charger state with `sweetbattery=1` |
| USB | Device mode at high speed as CDC-ECM Ethernet: phone 192.168.7.2, host 192.168.7.1, live kernel log on UDP 5140 (`sweetusb=2`). The fix was powering up the QUSB2 PHY that ABL leaves powered down (patches 0102, 0107-0109) |
| Wallpaper | Works once `lsd` re-seeds its database (patch 0099 makes the extension catalog readable; `sweetlsreset=1` once, or a fresh image, drops a database seeded before it) |
| Boot time | A few minutes on the Apple logo; the first boot of a fresh image also seeds the LaunchServices database once |
| In progress | GPU (Adreno 630) bring-up stages `sweetgpu=N` (patch 0103, untested on hardware; `docs/GPU_A630_BRINGUP.md`), Wi-Fi/Bluetooth probes `sweetwlan=N` (patch 0104; `docs/WIFI_BT_PLAN.md`) |
| Not working | Wi-Fi/modem, Bluetooth, GPU acceleration, audio, camera, sensors, SEP |

The boot used to stall on the Apple logo forever: MobileGestalt resolves the Wi-Fi MAC from `/chosen mac-address-wifi0`, else waits for an `IONetworkController` that never appears, once per question, while `lsd` seeds its database. The ADT now carries synthetic `mac-address-wifi0`/`mac-address-bluetooth0` (see `NOTES.md` for the whole bring-up log).

## Reproducing on the Poco F1 (macOS host)

Tools: `brew install --cask android-platform-tools`, `brew install aarch64-elf-gcc dtc zig blacktop/tap/ipsw`, AOSP `mkbootimg.py`; kernel from this repo's GitHub Actions (`xnu.yml`). Back up the phone's partitions first (`backup/`, see `NOTES.md`).

```sh
# iOS root (iPhone10,3 16.7.16 IPSW: OS, SystemOS, AppOS images; needs sudo to keep owners)
sudo tools/mkiosroot-macos.sh OS.dmg SystemOS.dmg AppOS.dmg ios16-root.img 20g
python3 tools/img2simg.py ios16-root.img ios16-root.simg
fastboot -S 512M flash userdata ios16-root.simg      # erases Android data
# boot image
python3 tools/mkadt.py shim/out/beryllium.adt --board beryllium --highmem --display-scale 2
python3 tools/mkpayload.py kernel.development.sweet shim/out/beryllium.adt payload.bin --cmdline 'debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=8 keepsyms=1 -noprogress rd=ufsroot0 unentitled_ios_sim_launch=1 ignition_level=1 wdt_test=no_user_checkin ufsrw=1 rootrw=1 launchd_unsecure_cache=1 wdt=-1 sweetfb_noconsole=1 sweetfb_hz=30 sweetfb_vsync=1 sweetfb_scale=1 sweetfb_flip=1 sweetusb=2 sweetbattery=1 sweetsample=-'
BOARD=beryllium shim/build.sh ../payload.bin && fastboot boot shim/out/shim-boot.img
```

Live log over USB: `tools/sweet-usbnet.sh logs/usb.txt` (macOS/Linux; gives the host 192.168.7.1 and listens on UDP 5140). Logs without USB: boot OrangeFox temporarily (`fastboot boot recovery.img`), then `tools/sweet-log-pull.sh` (kernel console ring) and `tools/sweet-ios-pull.sh` (iOS unified log via a static `hfsdump`).

**Upstream ios-sweet README (Redmi Note 10 Pro):** Apple's iOS 16 running on a Redmi Note 10 Pro.

This project ports Apple's open-source XNU kernel (xnu-8796, the iOS 16 generation) to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro (`sweet`, Qualcomm SM7150 / Snapdragon 732G). On top of it runs the **unmodified iOS 16.7.16 (20H392) userland of the iPhone X**: launchd, the system daemons, backboardd, SpringBoard and the stock apps.

As of **2026-10-18** the phone boots to the **iOS home screen**. You can unlock it, open Settings, pull down Control Center and the notification center, and use the touchscreen and the hardware buttons. Rendering runs entirely on the CPU; there is no GPU driver.

> Experimental bring-up, not a usable phone OS. Many things are missing or stubbed (see below), and Apple's security model is mostly switched off. It installs into the `userdata` partition and so **erases Android's user data**.

## What works

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Boot | Stock Xiaomi bootloader → `fastboot boot` of our shim → XNU. Nothing is flashed to the boot partitions |
| CPU | 6 of the 8 cores (the six Cortex-A55s) via PSCI, 16K pages, GICv3 interrupts, timers |
| Memory | About 3.95 GiB of the upper DDR bank |
| Storage | Own UFS host driver; the iOS root is a journaled HFS+ volume in `userdata`, read/write |
| iOS userland | Real iPhone X 16.7.16 root filesystem and shared cache; launchd and the system daemons run |
| Display | Kernel IOSurface + IOMobileFramebuffer (`AppleCLCD`) services; CoreAnimation renders in software; frames are copied into the bootloader's framebuffer. Presented to iOS as an iPhone X panel (1125×2436) |
| GUI | backboardd, SpringBoard, lock screen, home screen, Control Center, notification center, Settings |
| Touch | Goodix GT9896 over I²C (GENI), rail enabled through RPMh, delivered as HID digitizer events |
| Buttons | Power, volume up/down (PMIC through SPMI) as HID consumer keys; lock/wake works |
| Battery | IOPMPowerSource service (static 100 %, charging icon; real fuel-gauge readout prepared) |
| Device identity | iPhone X (`iPhone10,3` / `D22AP`): no Home button, gesture UI |
| Activation | Native "Hactivation" path of mobileactivationd, chosen through device-tree security status. No Apple servers involved |

## What does not work (yet)

- **No Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, audio, camera, sensors, GPS or SEP / Face ID.** Daemons for them start and fail or keep relaunching.
- **No GPU.** Everything is drawn by the CPU at roughly 20–30 fps. The two Cortex-A76 cores are not used yet.
- **Few apps.** The image has only what is on the system volume. There is no App Store, no Apple ID, and some Settings pages are empty.
- **Slow boot:** a few minutes on the Apple logo (CPU rendering, no GPU).
- **Security is off:** permissive code signing (AMFI) and sandbox policies, a stub AppleKeyStore, no data protection. Do not put anything personal on it.

## How it boots

```
ABL (stock Xiaomi bootloader, unlocked)
  -> fastboot boot shim-boot.img              (temporary; nothing is flashed to boot)
     -> shim: own MMU setup, reads the live FDT, loads the payload from the ramdisk
        -> XNU Mach-O + generated Apple Device Tree (ADT) + boot-args
           -> XNU -> UFS driver -> HFS+ root in the userdata partition
              -> dyld + shared cache -> launchd -> daemons -> backboardd + SpringBoard
```

There is no serial port (the debug UART is wired as SPI on this board). The kernel draws its console into the framebuffer that ABL leaves at `0x9c000000`, and keeps a persistent 4 MiB log ring at the end of `userdata`. You read that log from OrangeFox recovery with `tools/sweet-log-pull.sh`, so you don't have to film the screen.

## How to do it yourself

You need a Redmi Note 10 Pro (`sweet`, global or Indian variant, SM7150) with an **unlocked bootloader**, a Linux PC, and a GitHub account for the kernel build. This is the exact path used for the screenshots above; other variants or firmware may need changes. **Everything on `userdata` is lost.** Bootloaders, recovery, modem and persist partitions are never touched.

### 0. Back up the phone

Boot OrangeFox (or any recovery with adb root) temporarily and pull at least `persist`, `modemst1`, `modemst2`, `fsg`, `fsc` and `boot`, `dtbo`, `vbmeta`. They contain per-device calibration data. Keep them off git; `.gitignore` already excludes `backup/`, `dtb/` and `recovery/`.

The shim needs the stock DTB. Unpack your phone's stock `boot.img`:

```sh
python3 tools/unpack_bootv2.py backup/boot.img dtb/boot_unpacked   # -> dtb/boot_unpacked/dtb
```

### 1. Build the kernel

The kernel builds on GitHub's macOS runners with [blacktop/darwin-xnu-build](https://github.com/blacktop/darwin-xnu-build). The workflow fetches xnu-8796, applies `xnu/patches/` in order, and also stages the pinned open-source libpthread, HFS and BearSSL sources it needs. Fork the repo (public repos get free macOS minutes) and run:

```sh
gh workflow run xnu.yml -R YOU/ios-sweet
gh run download RUN_ID -R YOU/ios-sweet -n xnu-kernel -D xnu/out
```

To check a patch locally before spending a CI run, `tools/xnu-cc.py` replays the compile commands of a previous CI log for single files.

### 2. Build the iOS root image

Download the iPhone X (iPhone10,3) iOS 16.7.16 (20H392) IPSW from Apple. Then, on Linux, with `apfs-fuse`, `hfsprogs` and sudo:

```sh
# OS, SystemOS and AppOS disk images from the IPSW (see BuildManifest.plist for their names)
tools/mkiosroot.sh OS.dmg SystemOS.dmg AppOS.dmg ios16-root.img 16G
sudo fsck.hfsplus -fy ios16-root.img
sudo mount -t hfsplus -o loop,force ios16-root.img /mnt/iosroot
sudo python3 tools/sweet-root-tweaks.py /mnt/iosroot
sudo umount /mnt/iosroot
img2simg ios16-root.img ios16-root.simg
```

`mkiosroot.sh` copies the OS volume and both cryptexes into one case-sensitive journaled HFS+ volume. It adds the dyld cache links, the plain system keybag and the log directories the daemons expect. `sweet-root-tweaks.py` applies the bring-up changes: it skips Setup, seeds the activation state, removes the baseband daemon, disables the watchdogs that kill slow apps and the crash-looping media paths, and so on. The script's header explains each change.

The device tree builder copies `/product` from the real iPhone X device tree, which MobileGestalt needs. Extract it once, without downloading the whole IPSW:

```sh
python3 tools/remotezip.py IPSW_URL DeviceTree.d22ap.im4p research/ipsw-x/dt
ipsw img4 im4p extract research/ipsw-x/dt/Firmware/all_flash/DeviceTree.d22ap.im4p -o research/ipsw-x/d22ap.adt
```

### 3. Build the boot image

Needs `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` and `mkbootimg`.

```sh
python3 tools/mkadt.py shim/out/sweet.adt --highmem
python3 tools/mkpayload.py xnu/out/kernel.development.sweet shim/out/sweet.adt shim/out/payload.bin \
    --cmdline 'debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=6 keepsyms=1 -enable_kprintf_spam -noprogress rd=ufsroot0 unentitled_ios_sim_launch=1 ignition_level=1 wdt_test=no_user_checkin ufsrw=1 rootrw=1 launchd_unsecure_cache=1 wdt=-1 sweetfb_noconsole=1 sweetfb_hz=30'
shim/build.sh ../shim/out/payload.bin      # -> shim/out/shim-boot.img
```

What the less obvious boot-args do:

| Boot-arg | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `rd=ufsroot0 ufsrw=1 rootrw=1` | Root on the `userdata` partition, writable |
| `cpus=6` | Start the six A55 cores; `cpus=1` is the safe fallback |
| `launchd_unsecure_cache=1` | launchd accepts its job cache without AMFI |
| `wdt=-1 wdt_test=no_user_checkin` | No hardware watchdog |
| `sweetfb_noconsole=1` | Stop drawing kernel text over the GUI. It still goes to the persistent log; panics are drawn |
| `sweetfb_hz=30` | Panel refresh rate of the CPU copy |
| `sweettouch=0`, `sweetkeys=0` | Disable the touch or button driver |

### 4. Flash the root and boot

```sh
fastboot -S 512M flash userdata ios16-root.simg   # ~7 minutes; do not unplug
# Xiaomi's fastboot often hangs after a large flash: re-enter fastboot with Power + Volume down
fastboot boot shim/out/shim-boot.img
```

The first boot takes about 4–5 minutes on the Apple logo, then the lock screen appears. Swipe up to unlock. To get back to fastboot, hold Power + Volume down.

### 5. Read the kernel log

```sh
fastboot boot recovery/recovery.img        # OrangeFox, temporary
tools/sweet-log-pull.sh logs/boot.txt      # 4 MiB console ring from the end of userdata
adb reboot bootloader
```

The log contains crash reports with backtraces (`CRASH name ...`), IOKit traces of backboardd and SpringBoard, and the drivers' `SWEET ...` lines. `tools/sweet-crash.py` symbolicates them against the shared cache.

### QEMU

`tools/qemu-sweet.py` boots the same kernel on QEMU `virt` with a test RAM-disk root. It is useful for kernel-only changes; see `NOTES.md`.

## Key hardware facts

- RAM: payloads use the upper bank, `0x100000000` + `0xfcc00000` (about 3.95 GiB), above Qualcomm's protected carve-outs.
- GICv3 with security extensions: the timer goes through Group 1 IRQ (virtual timer INTID 19), not FIQ as on Apple silicon.
- PSCI through `smc`, 19.2 MHz timer, ARMv8.2 without pointer authentication. MPIDR uses Aff1 for the core number.
- Panel: 1080×2400 DSC video mode, continuous splash from ABL, no refresh kick needed.
- Touch: Goodix GT9896 at I²C `0x5d` on QUP SE7 (`0xa84000`), powered by PM6150L LDO11 through RPMh.
- Buttons: power and volume down on the PM6150 PON block, volume up on PM6150L GPIO2 (SPMI SID 4).
